-Need to look at the methods. Some most likely do not belong in there and belong in BookingManager instead
-Take a look at all the instance variables. There's an excess that are not necessary.

class DateRange
-can refactor by putting the ArgumentError into the make_reservation methods
-this class doesn't seem necessary.
